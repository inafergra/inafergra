## Hi there 👋

I'm Ignacio, a physicist working in scientific software development. My interests include quantum computing and quantum algorithms, as well as classical ML and AI.

I currently work at [Pasqal](https://www.pasqal.com/), where I spend most of my time developing software for novel quantum machine learning algorithms. 

### Cool software I've helped develop

During my time at Pasqal I've contributed to different projects, usually implementing the various propietary algorithms designed at Pasqal. Some of these algorithms include e.g. a quantum implementation of Physics Informed Neural Networks  ([Differentiable Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10395)) or a quantum optimization algorithm based on the extremal learning framework ([Quantum Extremal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02807)). Unfortunately, most of these algorithm implementations will remain closed source for the time being.

Some of the open source projects I regularly contribute to are [Qadence](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence), a python SDK for neutral atom quantum computing, and its extension packages [Qadence-libs](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence-libs) and  [Perceptrain](https://github.com/pasqal-io/perceptrain).

A good example of the kind of work I enjoy the most is my [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence-libs/blob/main/qadence_libs/qinfo_tools) of the Quantum Natural Gradient, a second-order gradient-based optimizer tailored for variational quantum algorithms.
