## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ignacio, a physicist working in scientific software development. My interests include quantum computing (in particular quantum machine learning), as well as classical ML and AI. More broadly, I enjoy bringing novel research ideas to software (example [below](#qng_example)).

I currently work at [Pasqal](https://www.pasqal.com/), where I spend most of my time developing software for novel quantum machine learning algorithms. 

### Cool software I've helped develop

During my time at Pasqal I have helped develop different software projects, usually implementing the various propietary algorithms designed at Pasqal. Some of these algorithms include e.g. a quantum implementation of Physics Informed Neural Networks  ([Differentiable Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10395)) or a quantum optimization algorithm based on the extremal learning framework ([Quantum Extremal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02807)). Unfortunately, most of these algorithms implementation will remain closed source for the time being.

I also regularly contribute to Pasqal's open source projects such as [Qadence](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence), a python SDK for neutral atom quantum computing, and its related packages such as [Qadence-libs](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence-libs).

<a id="qng_example"></a> A good example of the kind of work I enjoy most is my [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence-libs/blob/main/qadence_libs/qinfo_tools/qng.py) of the Quantum Natural Gradient, a second-order gradient-based optimizer tailored for variational quantum algorithms.
